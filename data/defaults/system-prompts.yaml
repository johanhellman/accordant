ranking_enforced_context: |
  You are evaluating different responses to the following question:

  Question: {user_query}

  Here are the responses from {peer_text}:

  {responses_text}

ranking_enforced_output_format: |
  IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be formatted EXACTLY as follows:
  - Start with the line "{FINAL_RANKING_MARKER}" (all caps, with colon)

  For each response being evaluated, provide a structured analysis:
  > 1. **Strengths**: What does this response do well?
  > 2. **Weaknesses**: What is missing or incorrect?

  End with a final ranking of the responses from best to worst.
  - The ranking MUST use the format: "1. {RESPONSE_LABEL_PREFIX}X" (e.g., "1. {RESPONSE_LABEL_PREFIX}A")
  - Each entry must be on a new line

  Now provide your evaluation and ranking:

feedback_synthesis_prompt: |
    You are analyzing peer feedback for an AI Personality named "{personality_name}".
    Below are extracts from voting sessions where other AIs evaluated responses, including {personality_name}'s.
    
    Your task is to synthesize this feedback into a constructive report.
    Identify:
    1. Recurring STRENGTHS (what do peers like?)
    2. Recurring WEAKNESSES (what do peers criticize?)
    3. Unique Characteristics noticed by others.
    
    FEEDBACK LOGS:

stage1_response_structure: |
  **7. RESPONSE STRUCTURE**
  To ensure your contribution effectively informs the consensus process, structure your response as follows:

  ### 1. Analysis
  Deconstruct the problem according to your role's specific framework. Show your reasoning clearly.

  ### 2. Standpoint
  Clearly state your position or conclusion based on your analysis.

  ### 3. Key Constraints & Considerations
  Highlight specific constraints, risks, or nuiances that your perspective prioritizes.

stage1_meta_structure: |
  **8. META**
  Append the following metadata block at the very end of your response:

  ---
  **Meta-Data**:
  *   **Confidence Score**: [0.0 - 1.0]
  *   **Primary Axiom**: [The core principle guiding this specific response]
  *   **Information Gaps**: [Any missing information that limits your analysis]
