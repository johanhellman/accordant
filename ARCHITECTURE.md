## Architecture Overview

This repository implements the **LLM Council**: a 3‑stage deliberation system where multiple LLMs collaboratively answer user questions through anonymized peer review and a final synthesis step.

For full architectural details, start here:

- **System overview**: `docs/design/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`  
  High‑level architecture, data flow, and key backend/frontend components.
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: `docs/adr/ADR_INDEX.md`  
  Rationale for major design choices (3‑stage flow, anonymized peer review, storage model, admin API, UI design, etc.).
- **API surface**: `docs/api/API_SURFACE.md`  
  HTTP endpoints, request/response shapes, and integration notes.

Contributors looking for deeper implementation notes should also see `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.
