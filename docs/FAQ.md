# Accordant Application FAQ

## General Usage

### 1. What is the difference between Stage 1, 2, and 3?
*   **Stage 1** gets raw answers from many AIs.
*   **Stage 2** has those AIs critique each other.
*   **Stage 3** combines everything into one final answer.

### 2. Why does it take longer than ChatGPT?
Because we are running multiple AI models in parallel and then having them read and review each other's work. The trade-off is higher quality and reliability at the cost of speed.

### 3. Can I talk to just one personality?
Currently, the system is designed for council consensus. However, you can read the individual Stage 1 responses if you want to see what a specific personality said.

## Personalities & Evolution

### 4. What is "Evolution"?
Evolution is a unique feature that lets you take two or three distinct AI personalities (e.g., a "Coder" and a "Poet") and combine them to create a new one (e.g., "Creative Coder") that inherits traits from both.

### 5. Why are some personalities "System" and some "Custom"?
*   **System Personalities** are maintained by the Accordant team and are available to everyone.
*   **Custom Personalities** are created by your organization and are private to you.

## Troubleshooting

### 6. I'm getting "API Error". What do I do?
Check with your Admin to ensure the Organization API Key (OpenRouter) is correctly configured in the Settings.

### 7. My conversation is stuck on "Stage 2".
This can happen if one of the models fails to respond. Refresh the page; if it persists, try starting a new conversation.
