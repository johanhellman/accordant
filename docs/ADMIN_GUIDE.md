## Managing Personalities

Accordant uses a **Structured Personality System**. This ensures that while each personality has a unique "Soul" (Identity, Tone, Reasoning), they all share a common "Body" (Structure, Metadata) to facilitate effective collaboration in the Council.

### Editing a Personality
When you edit a personality, you will see 6 specific sections:
1.  **IDENTITY & ROLE**: The core persona. Who are they?
2.  **INTERPRETATION OF QUESTIONS**: How do they view user queries?
3.  **PROBLEM DECOMPOSITION**: How do they break down complex tasks?
4.  **ANALYSIS & REASONING**: What is their logical framework?
5.  **DIFFERENTIATION & BIAS**: What specific angle or bias do they represent?
6.  **TONE**: What is their voice?

You do **not** need to define the output format (e.g., "Start with Analysis..."). This is handled automatically by the system.

### System Enforced Structure
In the "System Prompts" configuration, you can define:
*   **Enforced Response Structure**: The headings and organization every personality must use.
*   **Enforced Meta**: The metadata block (e.g., Confidence Score) that every personality must append.

Changing these in System Prompts will instantly update *all* personalities.
